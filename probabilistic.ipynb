Topics include: natural language processing for extracting relevant terms out of text data, vector space a methods for computing similarity between documents, text classification, and clustering. These techniques are commonly used in applications such as: automatic extraction of summaries out of a long text, extract novel information in a stream of data.\",  \n",

        "\"NLP algorithms are typically based on machine learning algorithms. Instead of hand-coding large sets of rules, NLP can rely on machine learning to automatically learn these rules by analyzing a set of examples (i.e. a large corpus, like a book, down to a collection of sentences), and making a statical inference. In general, the more data analyzed, the more accurate the model will be.\",  \n",

Between May and July of this year 143 million people in the U.S. may have had their names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and even driver's license numbers accessed. In addition, the hack compromised 209,000 people's credit card numbers and personal dispute details for another 182,000 people. What bad actors could do with that information is daunting.

Parents of tweens and teens often shrug off such anxious and gloomy thinking as normal irritability and moodiness â€” because it is. Still, the beginning of a new school year, with all of the required adjustments, is a good time to consider just how closely the habit of negative, exaggerated \"self-talk\" can affect academic and social success, self-esteem and happiness. Psychological research shows that what we think can have a powerful influence on how we feel emotionally and physically, and on how we behave. Research also shows that our harmful thinking patterns can be changed.\"\"\"]"
