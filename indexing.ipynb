Topics include: natural language processing for extracting relevant terms out of text data, vector space a methods for computing similarity between documents, text classification, and clustering. These techniques are commonly used in applications such as: automatic extraction of summaries out of a long text, extract novel information in a stream of data.\",  \n",

Instead of hand-coding large sets of rules, NLP can rely on machine learning to automatically learn these rules by analyzing a set of examples (i.e. a large corpus, like a book, down to a collection of sentences), and making a statical inference. In general, the more data analyzed, the more accurate the model will be.\",  \n",
